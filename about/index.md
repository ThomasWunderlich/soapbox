I'm a software developer and infrastructure engineer. Outside of work you can find me enjoying the outdoors, reading history or business books, attending NYCBUG meetings or contributing to open source projects.

Professionally, I help companies scale by building and improving backend systems and automating just about everything.  I typically work in a SOA environment with apis, whether they're RESTful, JSON-RPC or SOAP. That said I can help with just about anything, from prototyping, to data migrations, to server automation etc.

Currently you can find me learning the Microsoft stack with C#, Powershell and Chef.
